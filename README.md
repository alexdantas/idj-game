# Terminus for Windows

Terminus is a greek-themed game for Windows and GNU/Linux.

It was a team work for the classes "Introduction to Game Development"
and "Introduction to Game Design" of the Universidade de Brasilia,
Brazil. It was made over the whole 1st semester of 2013. 

Terminus was made completely from scratch (code, art and music) by a
partnership of 5 months between people from the departments of
Industrial Design, Computer Science and Music.
