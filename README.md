**Terminus** is a greek-themed game for Windows and GNU/Linux.

It was a team work for the classes *"Introduction to Game Development"* and
*"Introduction to Game Design"* of the *Universidade de Brasilia*, Brazil.
It was made over the whole 1st semester of 2013.

**Terminus** was made completely from scratch (code, art and music) by a
partnership of 5 months between people from the departments of *Industrial
Design*, *Computer Science* and *Music*.

## Plot

**Terminus** is a game of conquest, determination and hope.

Ancient Greece. You control **Apterus**, a horse whose dream is to become a
Pegasus. To do so, it builds a pair of mechanical wings and aims to climb the
mighty Mount Olympus - home of the Twelve Olympian gods.

It is believed that whoever survives through this journey may have his wishes
come true. The path, however, is filled with monsters and guardians who will
prevent anyone from climbing it at all costs.

Will **Apterus** ever become a Pegasus? Can you cross a path blocked by the
gods?
