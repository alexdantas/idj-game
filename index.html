<h2>Ambientation</h2>
<p>Terminus is a game of conquest, determination and hope.</p>

<p>Ancient Greece. You control Apterus, a horse whose dream is to become a Pegasus.
To do so, it builds a pair of mechanical wings and aims to climb the mighty Mount Olympus - home of the
Twelve Olympian gods.</p>
<p>It is believed that whoever survives through this journey may have his wishes come true.
The path, however, is filled with monsters and guardians who will prevent anyone from climbing it at
all costs.</p>
<p>Will Apterus ever become a Pegasus? Can you cross a path blocked by the gods?</p>
